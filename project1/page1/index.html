                The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
    
                The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of <span class="hexagon">hexagonal</span>
                galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the <span class="hexagon"> hexagons</span> one can see, 
                interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long 
                shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely 
                exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, 
                identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. 
                In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a 
                spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which 
                faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, 
                why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... 
                Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each 
                <span class="hexagon"> hexagon</span>. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.

            Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the 
            catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a 
            few leagues from the <span class="hexagon">hexagon</span> in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to 
            throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and 
            dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The 
            idealists argue that the <span class="hexagon">hexagonal</span> rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our 
            intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim 
            that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is 
            continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, 
            obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library 
            is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its <span class="hexagon">hexagons</span> and whose circumference is inaccessible. 

            There are five shelves for each of the <span class="hexagon">hexagon's</span> walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform 
            format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty 
            letters which are black in color.
