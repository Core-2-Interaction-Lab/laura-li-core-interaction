            The Anatomy of Melancholy, part 2, sect. II, mem. IV
    
            The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite 
            and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts 
            between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can 
            see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the 
            galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover 
            all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor 
            to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free 
            sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical 
            to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway 
            there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; 
            in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a 
            spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote 
            distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates 
            all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is 
            not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to 
            dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... 
            Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. 
            There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit 
            is insufficient, incessant.
