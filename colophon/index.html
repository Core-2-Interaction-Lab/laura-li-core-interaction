                This website was built by Laura Li for her second year university course Core 2: Interaction Studio/Lab. It is based on the short 
                story "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. The theme of the website revoles around the idea of an infinite library and its 
                never ending variations. 
                <br>
                The homepage begins as an interpretation of the physical library space and the idea of the selecting books off a shelf. 
                The typeface was chosen in accordance with the aesthetic of a ancicent all knowing library. The main page shows off the most interesting
                interactions done with HTML, CSS, and Javascript most notably the rotatable room.
